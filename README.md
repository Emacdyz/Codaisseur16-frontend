# Micro-services group assignment

This app is part of a more sophisticated app working with a Microservice architecture.

The app consists on a Quiz Creator Tool built for Codaisseur teacher. I was part of the front-end team, composed by 5 students in total. We were in collaboration with the micro-services (18 co-workers in total) to ensure connection between services. We first worked with dummy data to test the functionnality of the front-end React/Redux app. Then, we connected front-end with back-end with success (back-end using Typescript and TypeORM)

## Front - end Team

The front-end service is composed by two platforms: One for the teacher to create quiz and add/edit/delete quiz questions, one for the students to take the quiz and get their final score. Thoese 2 platforms are secured so signing up/ loging in/ loging out is possible.
